# SCDenizenBridge
This is a bridge for SimpleClans and Denizen that allows you writing your own
scripts with SimpleClans' API on Denizen.
## Why I made it?
I found Denizen to be handy and comfortable when it comes to some small changes on your server.

A lot of people are asking about short suggestions in SimpleClan's support guild,
but they usually seem to be individual (such as changing a GUI).
This is where SCDenizenBridge should fill that gap.
